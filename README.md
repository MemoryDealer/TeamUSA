# TeamUSA

This branch contains all of the required images as .png files to render the necessary background textures in-game. The files are subdivided into directories based on their usage in the game environment. The file LevelProgression.pdf contains a diagram showing the flow from scene to scene, and when each photo will be used by the game. 

In general, when viewing the files, images appended with letters indicate a decision branch in the game, and a specific branch can be traversed by viewing image
 files appended with the same letter. For example, file Floor3-11.png transitions to Floor3-12a.png or Floor3-12b.png. Selecting the 'a' branch, one would then
view Floor3-13a.png, and the branches merge together again at Floor3-14.png.
